      <h2>From the Founder</h2>
      <p>I started JuneHires with one goal — to help candidates, especially from Tier 2 and 3 cities, stand out and get hired. Most people don’t realize how far a renamed resume file or a simple thank-you note can go. We prep them for the basics. We charge companies, never candidates.</p>
